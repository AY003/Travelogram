# Travelogram
FRONTEND Mobile Application for Showcase
1. Travelogram:
• Built a community sharing travel feed page using Flutter(Frontend) and Firebase(Backend).
• Special care taken on the look/feel of the Page by using Attractive UI elements. • Use of Cloud Firestore and Firebase Storage(NoSQL cloud database to store and sync data for client- and server-side development) to host/fetch the data on UI elements.(Text,Images etc.)
• Use of firebase APIs in Flutter Framework.
• Difficulties Encountered: Used Firebase(Nosql Database) without having any previous experience with Databases so had to rely on intuitive understanding rather than any soild experience.
• Softwares/Frameworks Used: DART(Programming Language),Flutter Framework, Android Studio,Visual Studio Code, Firebase(NoSQL Database and Tools by Google)
